# FirstSprintBootAPI
My first REST springboot API. 

Returns "Hello" + input when no input is given, returns "Hello World".

This was made following the tutorial: https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service/ however, when creating this API the  page was having errors so I followed https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWLe1tqPmUo tutorial which went the original guide.
